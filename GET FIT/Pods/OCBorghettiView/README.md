OCBorghettiView is an easy to use accordion view component for iOS. It was named after [Renato Borghetti](http://youtu.be/xfsaGLesNHE?t=24s), a Brazilian folk musician and composer who works on the traditional style from his home state of Rio Grande do Sul. Borghetti's main instrument is the diatonic button accordion (known as *gaita* in Brazilian Portuguese).

## Under the Hood

* Uses ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)
* Supports device rotation
* Supports customization
* Supports UIViews as sections (UITableViews, UIWebView, MKMapView, etc...)
